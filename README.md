# Binance-Announcements
Web scraping for getting notifications on new announcements

Like it or not, everything Binance touches turns to gold. New listings on their platform are a great opportunity for traders, so they'd better be well-informed.

CHZ coin was listed on their platform yesterday, but unfortunately I missed the announcement on their webpage.

In order to not happen again, I've created a short script to get the notifications automatically from Binance page. It will run indefinitely in my computer, so everytime they release a new announcement, I'll receive a tweet.
